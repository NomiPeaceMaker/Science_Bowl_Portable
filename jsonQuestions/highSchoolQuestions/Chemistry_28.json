Then, he weighed the precipitate, and used stoichiometric conversions to estimate the number of moles of barium, and discovered that his method over-reported the actual value stated by his teacher. Which of the following plausibly explains the discrepancy?", "bonus_isShortAns": false, "bonus_MCQoptions": "W) The student precipitated both magnesium and barium when adding sodium sulfate\nX) The student used a molar mass for barium that was 10% too high\nY) The student used a molar mass for sulfur that was 10% too high\nZ) The student didn\u2019t properly dry his precipitate before weighing", "bonus_answer": "ANSWER: Z) THE STUDENT DIDN\u2019T PROPERLY DRY HIS PRECIPITATE BEFORE WEIGHING", "bonus_image": null}
